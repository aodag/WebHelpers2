TODO

Decide which helpers to port.

Test existing helpers on Python 3. 

Make webhelpers.html use MarkupSafe objects.

Consider replacing HTML builder function with a Stan-like HTML generator. It
must have an .\_\_html\_\_ method and escape its arguments.

Get documentation onto ReadTheDocs.

Convert all Doctests to unit tests. Consider whether to switch to Unittest 2.7
or stick to Nose.
